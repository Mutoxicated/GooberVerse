# The GooberVerse

Yes, that's right. It's here, *and it's real*... **the GooberVerse**. A 3D game-engine designed with PC multiplayer and singleplayer experiences in mind, written in Rust because I do NOT want to use a programming language designed with ancient mindsets (C) and unfocused direction (C++). 

I chose Rust because it is one of the languages that I really like since I never had any of the problems and inconveniences I've had with all other languages I've used (C#, C, C++ (*although admittedly not that much time with c++*), go and lua). On top of that, it has some amazing capabilities like proc macros and, most important of all, makes it easy for you to have a good workflow once you understand how the rust compiler thinks. Not only that, it has a really good idiomacy.

Anyway, I might expand this readme later with updates and showcases of progress, so stay tuned !!!
